			<p class="headline">We're In Love</p>
			<p>
				<div>You could absolutely break my heart</div>
				<div>That's how I know that we're in love</div>
				<div>I don't need the symbol of a scar</div>
				<div>So put down the knife, we're not swappin' blood</div>
			</p>
			<p>	
				<div>Isn't it enough that we stripped down to our skin?</div>
				<div>Cold and porcelain like bathers in a painting</div>
				<div>And I told you of your past lives, every man you've ever been</div>
				<div>It wasn't flattering, but you listened like it mattered</div>
			</p>
			<p>	
				<div>I feel crazy in ways I never say</div>
				<div>Will you still love me if it turns out I'm insane?</div>
				<div>I know what you'll say, but it helps to hear you say it anyway</div>
			</p>
			<p>	
				<div>Some October in the future, I'll run out of trash TV</div>
				<div>And I'll be feeling lonely, so I'll walk to karaoke</div>
				<div>Sing the song you wrote about me, never once checking the words</div>
				<div>I hope that no one sings along, I hope that I'm not a regular</div>
			</p>
			<p>	
				<div>Damn, that makes me sad, it doesn't have to be like that</div>
				<div>If you rewrite your life, may I still play a part?</div>
			</p>
			<p>	
				<div>In the next one, will you find me?</div>
				<div>I'll be the boy with the pink carnation</div>
				<div>Pinned to my lapel, who looks like hell and asks for help</div>
				<div>And if you do, I'll know it's you</div>
			</p>
			<p>	
				<div>I can't imagine you without the same smile in your eyes</div>
				<div>There is something about you that I will always recognize</div>
				<div>And if you don't remember, I will try to remind you</div>
				<div>Of the hummingbirds, you know the ones (I know the ones)</div>
			</p>
			<p>	
				<div>And the baby scorpion</div>
				<div>And the winter lunar halo</div>
				<div>And the walk we took in the Redwoods</div>
				<div>I could go on and on and on, and I will</div>
			</p>
			<p>	
				<div>Go on and on and on until</div>
				<div>It all comes back</div>
			</p>
